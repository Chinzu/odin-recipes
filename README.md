# odin-recipes
HTML project from Odin Fundations Course

## Description
This is the first project of the Fundation Course from The Odin Project.
The goal is to make a website for cooking recipes with a main page with a link for each recipe and a page per recipe. 
I'm no cooker so I ran out of imagination for this project. I used the suggested https://www.allrecipes.com/ for the recipes. 
Source Links are at the bottom of each recipes.

As you can see... I'm a japanese food enjoyer...


## Difficulties
I didn't met huge difficulties on this project. If I had to tell the major one : Make regular commits and clear commit messages. 
I hope I did some good ones as English is not my main language.
